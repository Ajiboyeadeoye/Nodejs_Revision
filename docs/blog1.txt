You've shown clear interest in software, have strong automotive hands-on experience, are taking a scholarship in JavaScript/Node.js, and have written an abstract focused on AI-driven automotive maintenance. You also currently work as an assistant lecturer, and your degrees (Math, Mech. Eng. ND, and MSc in Business Computing) give you a broad, applied background.

🧠 The Best Career Path for You: Software Engineer with AI + Automotive Focus
📌 Why? This plays to all your strengths: real-world problem solving, software skills, and your love for vehicles and intelligent systems. It gives you the flexibility of a global career in tech and still lets you specialize in automotive or smart systems if you choose.

🔑 Why Not Pure Research (PhD only)?
•	You don't yet have strong academic publications or research training — it’s possible, but would take extra time and preparation.
•	You can still grow into research later, once you're inside the industry or after a Master’s abroad.

🛣️ Best Career Track for You (Step-by-Step)
🔹 1. Become a Strong Software Engineer (General Path)
•	Goal: Get hired in 6–12 months or enter MSc abroad with funding.
•	Focus: Web development, backend (Node.js, Python), APIs, databases.
•	Tools: Git, Docker, Postman, PostgreSQL, AWS basics.
✅ Start building 1–2 real-world portfolio projects:
•	Predictive car maintenance web app using dummy OBD data
•	Fleet management dashboard for smart garages
•	Car parts marketplace with search and payment
✅ Learn deeper backend software engineering:
•	Node.js (Express.js)
•	Python (FastAPI or Django)
•	SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
✅ Certifications (free or low cost):
•	Meta Backend Developer (Coursera)
•	IBM DevOps or Software Engineer track
•	Google Cloud or AWS developer training

🔹 2. Apply Abroad for MSc or Software Engineering Roles
🎓 MSc First, Then Job or PhD
•	Apply to MSc in Software Engineering / Computer Science in Germany (free), Canada, or the USA.
•	Example programs:
o	TUM: MSc Automotive Software Engineering
o	University of Waterloo: MEng in Software Engineering
o	University of British Columbia: MSc in CS (software systems)
I can guide you through this — SOP, CV, school shortlist, etc.
💼 Or apply directly to software jobs (with portfolio)
•	Remote jobs (Turing, Andela, Upwork, Fiverr, Lemon.io)
•	Companies in Nigeria (Andela, Flutterwave, Kuda)
•	Internship programs abroad (Germany's Blue Card visa, Canada’s GTS, etc.)
________________________________________
🔹 3. Specialize or Pivot Later into AI or Automotive Software
Once you have:
•	1–2 years of real coding experience
•	Some projects or jobs completed
•	Then apply to:
o	PhD in Predictive Maintenance or Vehicle Software
o	Autonomous systems roles (Bosch, Tesla, Google)
o	Startups in AI-powered fleet management

🔧 Your Superpower
You’re a rare blend:
Mechanic + Programmer + Mathematician + Educator
That’s extremely powerful. The key is to first enter the software engineering industry, then specialize in AI/automotive once you're established.

  CCS 104 Internet Fundamental - Teaching Guide 
1. What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of computers that are all connected and can communicate with each other.
It allows people to:
•	Send emails
•	Browse websites
•	Share files
•	Watch videos
•	Use social media
 
 2. Basic Building Blocks of the Internet
a. IP Address
Every device on the Internet has a unique number called an IP address (like a phone number), e.g., 192.168.1.1.
 b. Domain Name
Instead of typing an IP address, we use names like google.com.
A Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain name into the correct IP address.
 c. Web Browser & URL
•	A web browser (Chrome, Firefox) is used to visit websites.
•	A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a web page, e.g., https://www.unilag.edu.ng.
 
 3. How the Internet Works
When you visit a website:
1.	Your device sends a request to a server (a computer that hosts the website).
2.	The server finds the webpage and sends it back to your browser.
3.	You see the webpage on your screen.
This communication happens using special rules called protocols.
 
4. Key Internet Protocols
•	HTTP/HTTPS – Used to load websites (https is secure).
•	TCP/IP – Breaks data into small packets and sends them reliably.
•	FTP – Used to upload and download files.
 
5. Internet vs. World Wide Web
•	The Internet is the physical network (wires, computers, routers).
•	The Web (WWW) is the part of the Internet that includes websites and pages.
Think of the Internet as roads, and the Web as shops and buildings you visit on those roads.

6. Common Internet Services
•	Email – Electronic messaging system
•	Web browsing – Visiting websites
•	Cloud storage – Saving files online (e.g., Google Drive)
•	Social networking – Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram
•	Video conferencing – Zoom, Google Meet
 
7. Internet Safety Tips
•	Use strong passwords.
•	Don’t click on suspicious links.
•	Keep your software and antivirus updated.
•	Be cautious about what you share online.
 
 8. Why the Internet Matters for You
For arts, science, or business, the Internet helps you:
•	Research and learn
•	Collaborate with others
•	Access global opportunities
•	Express your ideas and work
